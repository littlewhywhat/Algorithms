Algorithms
===========

This project includes the solutions to all programming assignments taken from the Stanford Coursera course “Algorithms: Design and Analysis”. The course consists of two parts. Here are the links to both:
[part 1](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo),
[part 2](https://www.coursera.org/course/algo2)

#####Implemented algorithms
* humming distance clustering
* floydwarshalalgo
* many others

#####Tests
Junit - for each algorithm

#####Build
Gradle Wrapper - just run gradlew build in Windows or ./gradlew in Linux
